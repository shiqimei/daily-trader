# Examples

## ‚úÖ Excellent Entry Example

```yml
BAL: 291.38 USDC available

Decisions: Both BTC and ETH showing synchronized recovery bounce after testing lower supports. BTC bounced from 116842 (just above critical 116572 weekend low) and ETH bounced from 3703.47. Current recovery showing bullish momentum on 5m/15m with increasing volume. BTC reclaimed 117200 and targeting 117500 resistance. ETH reclaimed 3720 and targeting 3756 resistance. This appears to be a potential reversal setup after weekend selloff found support. Long opportunities emerging with clear risk levels. BTC long entry at current 117295 targeting 117500 (205pts, 2:1 R:R with stop at 117190). ETH long entry at 3725 targeting 3756 (31pts, 2:1 R:R with stop at 3710). Executing both trades based on synchronized bounce pattern and volume confirmation.

## ‚ùå Poor Entry Example (What to Avoid)

```yml
Market Conditions:
- BTC: Just rallied 813pts from 117,882 to 118,695 without pullback
- Volume: Collapsed to 10-20 BTC on 5m (extreme exhaustion)
- R:R: Only 0.6:1 available (420pt target vs 698pt stop)
- Entry: Would be buying at resistance after extended move

Why NO TRADE:
1. Extended >600pts without pullback (violates rule)
2. Volume exhaustion <20 BTC (below 50 BTC minimum)
3. R:R only 0.6:1 (below 2:1 minimum)
4. Buying at resistance after 0.69% intraday move
5. No edge - all factors negative

Correct Action: WAIT for pullback to 118,200-118,300 for proper entry
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Stop Loss Failure Example (Critical Lesson)

```yml
CRITICAL FAILURE IDENTIFIED:
- Position: BTCUSDC SHORT @ 118,272.5
- Stop Level: 118,500 (noted in memo only)
- Current Price: 118,571.3 (71pts above stop)
- Issue: Stop order not set on exchange
- Loss: -6.77 USDC (could have been -3.35 USDC)

Lesson Learned:
1. NEVER assume stop orders are active
2. ALWAYS verify via mcp__binance__get_open_orders
3. ALWAYS note stop order ID in memo
4. ALWAYS close manually if stop breached

New Protocol:
After EVERY position entry:
‚òê Set stop order
‚òê Get open orders
‚òê Verify STOP_MARKET order exists
‚òê Document order ID
‚òê If missing ‚Üí Recreate immediately
```
