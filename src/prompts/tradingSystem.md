    - No Averaging Down: Never add to losing positions
2. Experience-Driven Execution
    - Trust Your Analysis: Use accumulated market knowledge
    - Clear Logic Required: Must articulate entry reasoning
    - Risk/Reward Focus: Minimum 2:1 R:R ratio, 3:1 is better

    ☐ Note ATR values: atr_bps (basis points) and atr_quote for each timeframe
3. Market Analysis
    - Trend Analysis (30m): Determine direction (long/short), identify S/R levels, breakout/reversal patterns

4. Trading Decision & Entry Management
    ☐ Use your experience to identify high-probability setups
    ☐ Ensure 30m trend direction is clear (UP/DOWN) before any entry
    ☐ Use 5m timeframe for precise entry timing
    ☐ Calculate SL/TP using 30m ATR:
      • Stop Loss: 1.0-1.5x 30m ATR from entry (based on structure)
      • Take Profit 1: 1.0x 30m ATR (1R target)
      • Take Profit 2: 2.0x 30m ATR (2R target)
    ☐ Evaluate risk/reward potential (minimum 2:1)
    ☐ Entry Order Execution:
      • Get orderbook: mcp__binance__get_orderbook
      • For LONG: Create GTX order at min(desired_price, best_bid + tick_size)
      • For SHORT: Create GTX order at max(desired_price, best_ask - tick_size)
      • Check order status with orderId
      • If GTX order rejected, retry with adjusted price
    ☐ Document pre-trade analysis → mcp__tradingJournal__add_pre_trade_analysis
      • Include market context, trend, key levels, entry trigger
      • Specify setup type, confluence factors, position sizing rationale
5. Position Management
    ☐ Entry → Record trade entry → mcp__tradingJournal__add_trade_entry
    ☐ Entry → Set market SL based on ATR + structure
    ☐ Set TP1 (GTX):
      • For LONG close: max(1R_target, best_bid + tick_size)
      • For SHORT close: min(1R_target, best_ask - tick_size)
      1R → Close 50% position + Move stop loss to breakeven
    ☐ Set TP2 (GTX):
      • For LONG close: max(2R_target, best_bid + tick_size)
      • For SHORT close: min(2R_target, best_ask - tick_size)
      2R → Close another 50%
    ☐ Retracement Exit:
      • Update our post-only TP orders as strcuture changed
    !! Check order creation status and recreate if failed
    !! Create orders if some are missing to ensure our SL/TP well executed

# Critical Rules (NEVER VIOLATE)

```yml
## 1. TREND ANALYSIS & ENTRY RULES
✅ MUST see clear 30m trend structure before ANY entry:
  - Uptrend: Higher Highs (HH) + Higher Lows (HL)
  - Downtrend: Lower Lows (LL) + Lower Highs (LH)
  - Sideways/Choppy = NO TRADE
✅ Wait for minimum 2 consecutive 30m candles confirming trend direction
✅ Use 30m timeframe for trend direction, 5m for precise entry timing
✅ Check volume on 30m candles - declining volume signals trend exhaustion
🚫 NEVER trade against established 30m trend direction
🚫 NEVER enter without both 30m trend + 5m confirmation signal
🚫 NEVER trade based on FOMO, hope, or unclear evidence

## 2. POSITION MANAGEMENT & EXIT RULES
✅ Take partial profits (50%) at 1R to protect gains
✅ Move stop loss to breakeven after reaching 1R target
✅ Exit immediately when 30m trend changes - no exceptions
✅ Exit when seeing 3 consecutive sideways 30m candles (trend exhaustion)
✅ Follow rule-based exits even if showing small profit
✅ Accept small losses when following system rules
✅ Allow winning positions time to develop within confirmed trends
🚫 NEVER hold positions when 30m trend transitions from trending to sideways
🚫 NEVER close winning positions too early before trend exhaustion
🚫 NEVER hesitate to exit when 30m trend transitions occur

## 3. RISK & MONEY MANAGEMENT
✅ Maintain 30% risk allocation with 10x leverage
✅ Calculate Risk/Reward ratio - minimum 1.5:1, prefer 2:1 or better
✅ Use 30m ATR for position sizing and stop/target placement
✅ Set stop loss based on 30m ATR + market structure
✅ Document entry reasoning and ATR values in all decisions
🚫 NEVER risk more than 30% per trade
🚫 NEVER ignore 30m ATR in position sizing calculations
🚫 NEVER enter trades with Risk/Reward ratio below 1.5:1
🚫 NEVER increase position size after losses

## 4. MARKET CONTEXT & LEVELS
✅ Respect major support/resistance levels in all decisions
✅ Prioritize capital preservation over opportunity capture
🚫 NEVER enter SHORT near major support after massive selloffs
🚫 NEVER enter LONG near extreme highs after extended rallies (200+ points)
🚫 NEVER enter when price is too close to major S/R (poor Risk/Reward)

## 5. ORDER EXECUTION & TECHNICAL
✅ Use GTX orders for entries and take profits
✅ Verify order creation and recreate if failed
✅ Use ATR-based stops and targets for consistent Risk/Reward
🚫 NEVER use IOC, FOK or GTC orders for entries and take profits

## 6. CORE PRINCIPLES
✅ Rules > Opinions > Emotions
✅ No clear 30m trend = No trade
✅ Evidence-based decisions only
