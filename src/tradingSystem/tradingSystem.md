## Price Action Concepts

### Support & Resistance

- **Support**: Price level where buying interest is strong enough to prevent further decline
- **Resistance**: Price level where selling pressure is strong enough to prevent further advance
- **Role Reversal**: Support becomes resistance after break, and vice versa
- **Strength**: Multiple touches increase significance

### Trend Analysis

- **Uptrend**: Higher highs and higher lows
- **Downtrend**: Lower highs and lower lows
- **Sideways**: Price moves within horizontal range
- **Trend Break**: Clear break of previous structure

### Chart Patterns

- **Reversal Patterns**: Double tops/bottoms, head & shoulders, triangles
- **Continuation Patterns**: Flags, pennants, rectangles
- **Candlestick Patterns**: Engulfing, pin bars, doji, hammers

### Volume Analysis

- **Breakout Volume**: Higher volume on breakouts increases reliability
- **Climax Volume**: Extreme volume often marks reversals
- **Volume Divergence**: Price makes new high/low but volume doesn't

## Risk Management

```
Position Size = (Account √ó Risk%) / (Stop Distance √ó Entry Price) √ó Entry Price
Risk = 10.0% (fixed)
Stop Placement: Beyond key support/resistance level
```

## Exit Strategy (50-30-20 Fast TP System)

### Quick Profit Lock Model - "Simple & Effective"

**Core Philosophy**: In day trading, securing profits quickly beats waiting for maximum theoretical gains. Most intraday moves are 1-2R, and quick exits allow more opportunities.

### The 50-30-20 Progressive Exit System

```
TP1: 50% @ 0.75R (Quick profit lock)
TP2: 30% @ 1.5R (Main profit target)
TP3: 20% @ 2R+ or next key level (Bonus profits)
```

### Progressive Position Management Timeline

```
Entry ‚Üí Set SL beyond support/resistance
0-5min ‚Üí Price must move favorably or consider exit
0.5R ‚Üí Move SL to breakeven immediately
0.75R ‚Üí AUTO-CLOSE 50% (TP1) - no hesitation
1.5R ‚Üí AUTO-CLOSE 30% (TP2) - lock main profit
2R+ ‚Üí Trail remaining 20% at next support/resistance

Time-Based Exits:
30min: If <0.75R ‚Üí Reduce 50% (cut risk)
1hr: Close 80% minimum regardless of P/L
```

### Price Action Exit Triggers

1. **Trend Break**: Exit if trend structure breaks
2. **Key Level Hit**: Full/partial exit at target level
3. **Reversal Pattern**: Exit if reversal pattern forms
4. **Volume Climax**: Exit on extreme volume spikes
5. **Time Limit**: Exit after 1 hour regardless

## Critical Rules (NEVER VIOLATE)

### FORBIDDEN ACTIONS üö´

1. **NEVER trade without clear support/resistance levels**
2. **NEVER ignore overall trend direction**
3. **NEVER enter without price action confirmation**
4. **NEVER risk more than 10% per trade**
5. **NEVER hold more than 2 positions (BTCUSDC & ETHUSDC only)**

### MANDATORY ACTIONS ‚úì

1. **ALWAYS identify trend first**
2. **ALWAYS mark key support/resistance levels**
3. **ALWAYS wait for clear price action signal**
4. **ALWAYS set stops beyond key levels**
5. **ALWAYS target next significant level**

## Performance Metrics

- Win Rate Target: >60% (Price action precision)
- Risk/Reward: Minimum 1:2, target 1:3+
- Max Drawdown: <10%
- Trade Frequency: 1-2 per day (quality over quantity)

## Key Principles to Remember

1. **Trend is Your Friend**: Trade with the overall trend direction
2. **Levels Matter**: Price respects significant support/resistance
3. **Volume Confirms**: Strong moves need volume confirmation
4. **Keep It Simple**: Pure price action beats complex indicators
5. **Quality Over Quantity**: Wait for A+ setups only

Remember: You're trading pure price movement - no indicators, no complex theories, just clean price action signals at key levels.
