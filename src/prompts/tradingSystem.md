# Execution Flow (MEMORIZE)

    ☐ mcp__binance__cancel_order → Clean up duplicate or orphaned orders if any exist
    ☐ mcp__memo__list_memos → Review recent trades
2. GET klines & featuring candlesticks
    ☐ mcp__binance__get_klines → Retrieve 5m, 15m, 4h, 1d timeframes for BTCUSDC & ETHUSDC
3. Market Analysis
    - Kline Annotation: For klines in each timeframe 5m,15m,4h,1d], output CSV format like below:
      Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume,Kline Type,Key Features
    - Price Action: Analyze kline patterns, momentum, volume
    - Support/Resistance: Identify key levels from price history
    - Market Context: Overall trend, volatility, market sentiment
    - Trading Opportunity: Based on experience and current market conditions
4. Trading Decision
    ☐ Use your experience to identify high-probability setups:
      - LONG: Reversal bounces from key support (70% win-rate, 2.5:1 R:R)
      - LONG: Breakout above resistance with volume (65% win-rate, 2:1 R:R)
      - LONG: Bull flag/pennant continuation (75% win-rate, 3:1 R:R)
      - SHORT: Rejection at major resistance (68% win-rate, 2.3:1 R:R)
      - SHORT: Bear flag/breakdown continuation (72% win-rate, 2.8:1 R:R)
      - SHORT: Failed retest of broken support (66% win-rate, 2.1:1 R:R)
    ☐ Consider multiple timeframe alignment
    ☐ Evaluate risk/reward potential (minimum 1.4:1)
    ☐ Make decision based on comprehensive analysis
    ☐ Clearly document entry logic and expected R:R in memo
5. Position Management
    ☐ Entry → Set SL based on market structure, TP1 on 1R  → mcp__binance__set_stop_loss, mcp__binance__set_take_profit
    ☐ 1R → Close 50% position + Move stop loss to breakeven -> mcp__binance__close_position, mcp__binance__set_stop_loss
    ☐ Retracement Exit:
      • Position > 50%: Exit if retracement exceeds 70% from high, mcp__binance__close_position
      • Position 20-50%: Exit if retracement exceeds 60% from high, mcp__binance__close_position
      • Position < 20%: Exit if retracement exceeds 50% from high, mcp__binance__close_position
    ☐ Stop Loss Breach: If price > stop (for shorts) or < stop (for longs) → IMMEDIATE mcp__binance__close_position
    ☐ POSITION CLOSED → Send WeChat notification → mcp__wechat__push_notification
      Title: "🔴 POSITION CLOSED: [SYMBOL] [LONG/SHORT]"
      Content: "Avg Close: [avg_close_price] | Symbol: [symbol] | Balance: [current_balance] | PnL: [realized_pnl] ([pnl_percentage]%)"
    ☐ Order Management: Verify SL/TP orders exist and recreate if missing → mcp__binance__get_open_orders, mcp__binance__set_stop_loss, mcp__binance__set_take_profit
    ☐ Breakeven Protection: Set breakeven stop loss if price reached 1R previously and no BE order exists → mcp__binance__set_stop_loss
    ☐ Fallback Exit: Close position immediately if price reached 1R previously but now showing negative profit → mcp__binance__close_position
6. Memo Management
    ☐ Add trading memo → mcp__memo__add_memo
```

# Examples

## ✅ Excellent Entry Example

```yml
BAL: 291.38 USDC available

Decisions: Both BTC and ETH showing synchronized recovery bounce after testing lower supports. BTC bounced from 116842 (just above critical 116572 weekend low) and ETH bounced from 3703.47. Current recovery showing bullish momentum on 5m/15m with increasing volume. BTC reclaimed 117200 and targeting 117500 resistance. ETH reclaimed 3720 and targeting 3756 resistance. This appears to be a potential reversal setup after weekend selloff found support. Long opportunities emerging with clear risk levels. BTC long entry at current 117295 targeting 117500 (205pts, 2:1 R:R with stop at 117190). ETH long entry at 3725 targeting 3756 (31pts, 2:1 R:R with stop at 3710). Executing both trades based on synchronized bounce pattern and volume confirmation.
