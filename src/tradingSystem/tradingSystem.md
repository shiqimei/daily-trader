# Execution Flow (MEMORIZE)

For each run, starting from receiving a user message: `UTC:{timestamp}`:

```yml
1. GET Account Status & Order Management
    ☐ mcp__binance__get_account → Check balance, positions
    ☐ mcp__binance__get_open_orders → Check open orders
    ☐ mcp__binance__cancel_order → Clean up duplicate or orphaned orders if any exist
    ☐ mcp__memo__list_memos → Review recent trades
2. GET klines & featuring candlesticks
    ☐ mcp__binance__get_klines → Retrieve 5m, 15m, 4h, 1d timeframes for BTCUSDC & ETHUSDC
    ☐ [for klines in each timeframe 5m,15m,4h,1d] output:
      Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume,Kline Type,Key Features
3. Market Analysis
    - Price Action: Analyze kline patterns, momentum, volume
    - Support/Resistance: Identify key levels from price history
    - Market Context: Overall trend, volatility, market sentiment
    - Trading Opportunity: Based on experience and current market conditions
4. Trading Decision
    ☐ Use your experience to identify high-probability setups
    ☐ Consider multiple timeframe alignment
    ☐ Evaluate risk/reward potential (minimum 2:1)
    ☐ Make decision based on comprehensive analysis
    ☐ Clearly document entry logic and expected R:R in memo
5. Position Management
    ☐ Entry → Set SL based on market structure, TP1 on 1R  → mcp__binance__set_stop_loss, mcp__binance__set_take_profit
    ☐ 1R → Close 50% position + Move stop loss to breakeven -> mcp__binance__close_position, mcp__binance__set_stop_loss
    ☐ 2R → Close another 30% (total 80% closed) + Trail stop based on price action -> mcp__binance__close_position, mcp__binance__set_trailing_stop
    ☐ Retracement Exit:
      • Position > 50%: Exit if retracement exceeds 70% from high, mcp__binance__close_position
      • Position 20-50%: Exit if retracement exceeds 60% from high, mcp__binance__close_position
      • Position < 20%: Exit if retracement exceeds 50% from high, mcp__binance__close_position
    Create orders if some are missing to make our SL/TP well executed
6. Memo Management
    ☐ Add trading memo → mcp__memo__add_memo
