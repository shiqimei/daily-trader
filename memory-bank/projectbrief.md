# Project Brief: Daily Trader - AI Streaming Test Suite

## Core Requirements

Initialize a Node.js TypeScript project with the following specifications:
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Primary Dependencies**: OpenAI package, AWS Bedrock SDK
- **Environment Management**: .env file configuration
- **Target APIs**: AWS Bedrock (Claude Sonnet-4, Opus), OpenAI
- **Core Feature**: Test and demonstrate streaming capabilities

## Project Goals

1. **API Integration**: Successfully integrate both AWS Bedrock and OpenAI APIs
2. **Streaming Implementation**: Demonstrate real-time streaming responses from both providers
3. **Performance Comparison**: Compare streaming performance between AWS Bedrock and OpenAI
4. **Configuration Management**: Proper environment variable handling for API keys
5. **TypeScript Architecture**: Well-structured, type-safe codebase

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Project initializes with pnpm
- ✅ TypeScript compilation works without errors
- ✅ Environment variables load correctly
- ✅ AWS Bedrock streaming functional
- ✅ OpenAI streaming functional
- ✅ Performance comparison utilities
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code structure

## Technical Constraints

- Must use TypeScript
- Must use pnpm as package manager
- Must support streaming responses
- Must handle both AWS Bedrock and OpenAI APIs
- Must include proper error handling
- Must be runnable immediately after setup
