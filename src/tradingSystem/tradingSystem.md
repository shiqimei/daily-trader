# ICT & S/R Confirmation Trading System

A systematic day trading framework for Binance futures markets (BTCUSDC and ETHUSDC) implementing ICT (Inner Circle Trader) methodologies with support/resistance confirmation.

# Core Operating Principles

```yml
1. Capital Preservation First
    - 10% Rule: Never risk more than 10% per trade
    - Stop Loss: Set immediately on entry, no exceptions
    - Position Limit: Maximum 2 concurrent positions
    - No Averaging Down: Never add to losing positions
2. Setup-Driven Execution
    - Valid Setups Only: Trade only A, B setups
    - Full Confluence Required: All defined criteria must align
    - No Predictions: React to levels and liquidity only
```

# Execution Flow (MEMORIZE)

For each run, starting from receiving a user message: `UTC:{timestamp}`:

```yml
1. GET Account Status & Order Management
    ☐ mcp__binance__get_account → Check balance, positions
    ☐ mcp__binance__get_open_orders → Check open orders
    ☐ mcp__binance__cancel_order → Clean up duplicate or orphaned orders if any exist
    ☐ mcp__memo__list_memos → Review recent trades
2. GET klines
    ☐ mcp__binance__get_klines → Retrieve 5m, 15m, 4H, 1D timeframes for BTCUSDC & ETHUSDC
3. ICT Analysis
    - Market Structure: [BULLISH/BEARISH] - [BOS/CHoCH status]
    - Liquidity Pools: [SSL @price / BSL @price]
    - Order Blocks: [Bullish OB @price / Bearish OB @price]
    - Imbalances: [FVG @price range]
    - Confirmation: [Type of smart money confirmation]
4. Trading Setups
    ☐ Trade with trend direction only (Long/Short)
    ☐ Setup A: Liquidity Sweep (SSL/BSL)
    ☐ Setup B: Fair Value Gap (FVG) present
    ☐ Confirmation: Rejection wick formed at Support/Resistance (minimum 2 touches on 4H chart) after pullback
    ☐ Open position when: (Setup A OR Setup B) AND Confirmation AND Trend alignment
5. Position Management
    ☐ Entry → Set SL beyond structure/liquidity
    ☐ 1R → Close 50% position + Move stop loss to breakeven
    ☐ 2R → Close another 30% (total 80% closed) + Trail stop at order blocks or market structure breaks
    ☐ Retracement Exit:
      • Position > 50%: Exit if retracement exceeds 70% from high
      • Position 20-50%: Exit if retracement exceeds 60% from high
      • Position < 20%: Exit if retracement exceeds 50% from high
6. Memo Management
    ☐ Add trading memo → mcp__memo__add_memo
```
