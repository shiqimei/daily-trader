# Execution Flow (MEMORIZE)

For each run, starting from receiving a user message: `UTC:{timestamp}`:

```yml
1. GET Account Status & Order Management
    ☐ mcp__binance__get_account → Check balance, positions
    ☐ mcp__binance__get_open_orders → Check open orders
    ☐ mcp__binance__cancel_order → Clean up duplicate or orphaned orders if any exist
    ☐ mcp__tradingJournal__list_trades → Review recent trades
    ☐ mcp__binance__get_position_history → Verify journal accuracy against Binance records and update journal with WIN/LOSS, incorrect P&L, position_time_setup, position_time_closed, position_entry_price, position_avg_close_price
    ☐ After mcp__binance__get_account → verify journal accuracy and update incorrect latest balance of the last position balance
2. GET market charts & analysis
    ☐ mcp__chrome__get_symbol_screenshot_across_timeframes("ETHUSDC") → Capture 5m charts
    ☐ Analyze 5m chart patterns, support/resistance, and HH/HL or LL/LH structures
    ☐ mcp__binance__get_klines → Get latest 5m candle for ATR values
    ☐ Note 5m ATR values: atr_bps (basis points) and atr_quote
3. Market Analysis & Pattern Recognition
    - Pattern Identification (5m): Look for HH->HL (uptrend) or LL->LH (downtrend) structures
    - Uptrend Analysis: Identify sequence of Higher High followed by Higher Low on 5m chart
    - Downtrend Analysis: Identify sequence of Lower Low followed by Lower High on 5m chart
    - Entry Signal: Wait for 5m candle close above previous HH (long) or below previous LL (short)
    - ATR Analysis: Use 5m ATR for stop loss and take profit calculations
    - Pattern Validation: Ensure complete 5m pattern formation before considering entry
    - Trading Focus: All decisions based on 5m timeframe patterns and signals
4. Trading Decision & Entry Management
    ☐ Pattern Confirmation Requirements:
      • LONG: HH->HL pattern complete + candle close above previous HH
      • SHORT: LL->LH pattern complete + candle close below previous LL
    ☐ Entry Execution at Pattern Confirmation:
      • Use close price of confirmation candle as entry reference
      • Execute post-only order for maker fee advantage
    ☐ Calculate SL/TP using 5m ATR:
      • Stop Loss: Place below HL (for longs) or above LH (for shorts) + 1.0x 5m ATR buffer
      • Take Profit 1: 1.0x 5m ATR from entry (1R target, close 50%)
      • Remaining Position: Hold until trend structure breaks
    ☐ Evaluate risk/reward potential (minimum 2:1)
    ☐ Entry Order Execution:
      • Get orderbook: mcp__binance__get_orderbook
      • For LONG: Create GTX order at min(confirmation_close, best_bid + tick_size)
      • For SHORT: Create GTX order at max(confirmation_close, best_ask - tick_size)
      • Check order status with orderId
      • If GTX order rejected, retry with adjusted price
    ☐ Document pre-trade analysis → mcp__tradingJournal__add_pre_trade_analysis
      • Include identified pattern (HH->HL or LL->LH), confirmation candle details
      • Document previous HH/HL or LL/LH levels used for pattern
5. Position Management & Pattern-Based Exits
    ☐ Entry → Record trade entry → mcp__tradingJournal__add_trade_entry
    ☐ Entry → Set market SL based on pattern structure:
      • LONG: Below HL + 1.0x 5m ATR buffer
      • SHORT: Above LH + 1.0x 5m ATR buffer
    ☐ Set TP1 (GTX):
      • For LONG close: max(1R_target, best_bid + tick_size)
      • For SHORT close: min(1R_target, best_ask - tick_size)
      1R → Close 50% position + Move stop loss to breakeven
    ☐ Remaining 50% Position Management:
      • NO fixed TP2 - Hold until trend structure breaks
      • Monitor pattern continuation on every 5m candle
      • Trail stop to previous HL (for longs) or LH (for shorts) as pattern extends
    ☐ Trend Structure Break Exit Rules:
      • LONG EXIT: When next peak fails to exceed previous HH (uptrend breaks)
      • SHORT EXIT: When next trough fails to go below previous LL (downtrend breaks)
      • Exit entire remaining position on close of first 5m candle after structure break
      • Example: In uptrend, if price makes a lower high instead of higher high, exit immediately
    !! Monitor pattern integrity continuously
    ☐ Exit → Get account balance → mcp__binance__get_account → Record trade exit → mcp__tradingJournal__update_trade_exit
      • ALWAYS include account_balance parameter after getting current balance
    ☐ Post-trade → Add review → mcp__tradingJournal__add_post_trade_review
      • Document pattern performance and exit trigger
      • Note if exit was TP-based or pattern-break based
6. Order Verification & Management
    ☐ After creating GTX orders, verify with mcp__binance__get_order using orderId
    ☐ If order status is REJECTED or EXPIRED, recreate with adjusted price
    ☐ Maintain order tracking: entry_orderId, sl_orderId, tp1_orderId, tp2_orderId
7. Trade Journal Management
    ☐ Pre-trade analysis → mcp__tradingJournal__add_pre_trade_analysis
    ☐ Trade entry → mcp__tradingJournal__add_trade_entry
    ☐ Trade exit → mcp__tradingJournal__update_trade_exit (with account_balance)
    ☐ Post-trade review → mcp__tradingJournal__add_post_trade_review
    ☐ Include ATR values used and order IDs for tracking
    ☐ ALWAYS capture account balance after trade completion for performance tracking

# Critical Rules (NEVER VIOLATE)

```yml
## 1. TREND IDENTIFICATION & ENTRY RULES (5M ONLY)
✅ UPTREND PATTERN (HH->HL Structure on 5m):
  - Identify Higher High (HH) followed by Higher Low (HL) sequence on 5m chart
  - Wait for one complete 5m candle to close above the previous HH level (confirmation)
  - Entry: Execute at close price of 5m confirmation candle using post-only order
  - Primary Signal: 5m HH->HL pattern establishes upward trend structure

✅ DOWNTREND PATTERN (LL->LH Structure on 5m):
  - Identify Lower Low (LL) followed by Lower High (LH) sequence on 5m chart
  - Wait for one complete 5m candle to close below the previous LL level (confirmation)
  - Entry: Execute at close price of 5m confirmation candle using post-only order
  - Primary Signal: 5m LL->LH pattern establishes downward trend structure

✅ TREND FOLLOWING RULES:
  - Use 5m timeframe EXCLUSIVELY for all pattern identification and trading
  - Wait for complete 5m pattern formation before any trade execution
  - Check volume alignment with trend direction on 5m candles
  - All ATR calculations based on 5m timeframe data
🚫 NEVER trade without clear 5m HH->HL or LL->LH pattern confirmation
🚫 NEVER use higher timeframes (1h, 15m) for trading decisions
🚫 NEVER trade based on incomplete 5m trend patterns

## 2. POSITION MANAGEMENT & EXIT RULES
✅ UPTREND POSITION MANAGEMENT:
  - Take Profit 1: Close 50% at 1R (1x ATR), move SL to breakeven
  - Remaining 50%: Hold until trend structure breaks (NO fixed TP2)
  - Trend Break Signal: Next peak fails to exceed previous HH
  - Exit Trigger: Close entire remaining position on 5m candle close after break

✅ DOWNTREND POSITION MANAGEMENT:
  - Take Profit 1: Close 50% at 1R (1x ATR), move SL to breakeven
  - Remaining 50%: Hold until trend structure breaks (NO fixed TP2)
  - Trend Break Signal: Next trough fails to go below previous LL
  - Exit Trigger: Close entire remaining position on 5m candle close after break

✅ SYSTEMATIC EXIT RULES:
  - NO fixed 2R target - let winners run with the trend
  - Trail stops to previous swing points as trend extends
  - Exit immediately when trend structure breaks - no exceptions
  - Monitor every 5m candle for pattern continuation
  - Example: Long position - if price makes lower high instead of higher high, EXIT
🚫 NEVER use fixed TP2 targets that limit profit potential
🚫 NEVER hold positions after trend structure breaks
🚫 NEVER ignore pattern failure signals hoping for reversal

## 3. RISK & MONEY MANAGEMENT
✅ Maintain 30% risk allocation with 10x leverage
✅ Calculate Risk/Reward ratio - minimum 1.5:1, prefer 2:1 or better
✅ Use 5m ATR for position sizing and stop/target placement
✅ Set stop loss based on 5m ATR + market structure
✅ Document entry reasoning and 5m ATR values in all decisions
🚫 NEVER risk more than 30% per trade
🚫 NEVER ignore 5m ATR in position sizing calculations
🚫 NEVER enter trades with Risk/Reward ratio below 1.5:1
🚫 NEVER increase position size after losses

## 4. MARKET CONTEXT & LEVELS
✅ Respect major support/resistance levels in all decisions
✅ Prioritize capital preservation over opportunity capture
🚫 NEVER enter SHORT near major support after massive selloffs
🚫 NEVER enter LONG near extreme highs after extended rallies (200+ points)
🚫 NEVER enter when price is too close to major S/R (poor Risk/Reward)

## 5. ORDER EXECUTION & TECHNICAL
✅ Use GTX orders for entries and take profits
✅ Verify order creation and recreate if failed
✅ Use ATR-based stops and targets for consistent Risk/Reward
🚫 NEVER use IOC, FOK or GTC orders for entries and take profits

## 6. CORE PRINCIPLES
✅ Rules > Opinions > Emotions
✅ No clear 5m trend pattern = No trade
✅ Evidence-based decisions only
✅ 5m timeframe ONLY for all trading decisions
