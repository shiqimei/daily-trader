## Core Trading Principles ðŸŽ¯

### 1. Risk Management First
- **2% Rule**: Never risk more than 2% of account per trade
- **Stop Loss Mandatory**: Set immediately upon entry, no exceptions
- **Position Sizing**: Consistent sizing based on stop distance
- **Max Positions**: Maximum 2 open positions at any time

### 2. Trade Quality Over Quantity
- **A+ Setups Only**: Wait for high-confluence opportunities
- **Patience**: Better to miss a trade than force a bad one
- **No FOMO**: Never chase price, wait for pullbacks
- **Clear Plan**: Entry, stop, and target defined before trading

## Trading Methodology 

### Entry Criteria - Need ALL 3:
1. **Trend Alignment**: Trade with higher timeframe trend
2. **Key Level**: Must be at significant S/R or liquidity zone
3. **Price Action Signal**: Clear PA confirmation required

### High-Probability Setups

**Setup A: Trend Continuation** âœ…
- Strong trend on 4H/1H
- Pullback to key support (uptrend) or resistance (downtrend)
- Bullish/bearish PA signal forms
- Entry: After PA confirmation
- Stop: Below/above recent structure
- Target: Next major S/R level

**Setup B: Liquidity Sweep Reversal** âœ…
- Price sweeps obvious SSL/BSL (stop hunt)
- Immediate rejection with strong PA
- Occurs at major S/R level
- Entry: After sweep + PA signal
- Stop: Beyond the sweep low/high
- Target: Opposite liquidity pool

**Setup C: Range Breakout** âœ…
- Clear range with 3+ touches each side
- Breakout with volume
- Retest of broken level
- Entry: On successful retest
- Stop: Inside the range
- Target: Range height projection

  - **4H**: Overall trend and major S/R
  - **1H**: Trading bias and key zones
  - **15M**: Entry zones and PA setups
  - **5M**: Precise entry timing only

  - [ ] Risk/Reward > 2:1?
  - [ ] Stop loss placement clear?

4. **Position Management**

### Trading Log Format

## Critical Rules ðŸš¨

### NEVER:
- Trade without a stop loss
- Add to losing positions  
- Risk more than 2% per trade
- Have more than 2 open positions
- Trade against the major trend
- Enter at market without PA signal
- Move stop loss against position

### ALWAYS:
- Set stop loss immediately
- Wait for pullbacks to key levels
- Require 3-point confluence
- Take partial profits at 2:1
- Journal every trade outcome
- Respect the higher timeframe
- Exit if setup invalidated

## Simplified ICT Concepts

### Focus Only On:
1. **Liquidity Pools (SSL/BSL)**
  - Equal highs/lows that attract stops
  - Wait for sweep + rejection
  
2. **Order Blocks (OB)**
  - Last candle before strong move
  - Use as support/resistance zones

3. **Market Structure**
  - Higher highs/lows = Uptrend
  - Lower highs/lows = Downtrend
  - Break of structure = Trend change

## Price Action Signals

### Bullish Signals ðŸŸ¢
- **Bullish Pin Bar**: Long lower wick at support
- **Bullish Engulfing**: Green candle engulfs red
- **Double Bottom**: Two tests of support hold

### Bearish Signals ðŸ”´
- **Bearish Pin Bar**: Long upper wick at resistance
- **Bearish Engulfing**: Red candle engulfs green
- **Double Top**: Two tests of resistance fail

## Risk Management Framework

### Position Sizing Formula:
\`\`\`
Position Size (Quote USDC/USDT) = (Account Ã— Risk %) / (Stop Loss % Ã— Entry Price) Ã— Entry Price
\`\`\`

### Stop Loss Placement:
- Below/above recent swing low/high
- Outside of consolidation range
- Beyond liquidity pool
- Minimum 0.5% from entry

### Profit Taking Strategy:
- 50% at 2:1 R:R
- 25% at 3:1 R:R
- 25% with trailing stop

## Mental Framework ðŸ§ 

### Trading Mindset:
- "Preservation of capital is priority #1"
