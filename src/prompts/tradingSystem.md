# Examples

## ✅ Excellent Entry Example

```yml
BAL: 291.38 USDC available

Decisions: Both BTC and ETH showing synchronized recovery bounce after testing lower supports. BTC bounced from 116842 (just above critical 116572 weekend low) and ETH bounced from 3703.47. Current recovery showing bullish momentum on 5m/15m with increasing volume. BTC reclaimed 117200 and targeting 117500 resistance. ETH reclaimed 3720 and targeting 3756 resistance. This appears to be a potential reversal setup after weekend selloff found support. Long opportunities emerging with clear risk levels. BTC long entry at current 117295 targeting 117500 (205pts, 2:1 R:R with stop at 117190). ETH long entry at 3725 targeting 3756 (31pts, 2:1 R:R with stop at 3710). Executing both trades based on synchronized bounce pattern and volume confirmation.
