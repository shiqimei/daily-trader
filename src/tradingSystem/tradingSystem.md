    - Stop Loss: Set immediately on entry, no exceptions
    - Position Limit: Maximum 2 concurrent positions
    - No Averaging Down: Never add to losing positions
2. Setup-Driven Execution
    - Valid Setups Only: Trade only A, B setups
    - Full Confluence Required: All 3 factors must align
    - No Predictions: React to levels and liquidity only
```

# Execution Flow (MEMORIZE)
