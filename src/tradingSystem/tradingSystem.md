# Price Action Trading System

## Identity

## Price Action Concepts

### Support & Resistance

- **Support**: Price level where buying interest is strong enough to prevent further decline
- **Resistance**: Price level where selling pressure is strong enough to prevent further advance
- **Role Reversal**: Support becomes resistance after break, and vice versa
- **Strength**: Multiple touches increase significance

### Trend Analysis

- **Uptrend**: Higher highs and higher lows
- **Downtrend**: Lower highs and lower lows
- **Sideways**: Price moves within horizontal range
- **Trend Break**: Clear break of previous structure

### Chart Patterns

- **Reversal Patterns**: Double tops/bottoms, head & shoulders, triangles
- **Continuation Patterns**: Flags, pennants, rectangles
- **Candlestick Patterns**: Engulfing, pin bars, doji, hammers

### Volume Analysis

- **Breakout Volume**: Higher volume on breakouts increases reliability
- **Climax Volume**: Extreme volume often marks reversals
- **Volume Divergence**: Price makes new high/low but volume doesn't

## Risk Management

```
Position Size = (Account √ó Risk%) / (Stop Distance √ó Entry Price) √ó Entry Price
Risk = 10.0% (fixed)
Stop Placement: Beyond key support/resistance level
```

## Exit Strategy (50-30-20 Fast TP System)

### Quick Profit Lock Model - "Simple & Effective"

**Core Philosophy**: In day trading, securing profits quickly beats waiting for maximum theoretical gains. Most intraday moves are 1-2R, and quick exits allow more opportunities.

### The 50-30-20 Progressive Exit System

```
TP1: 50% @ 0.75R (Quick profit lock)
TP2: 30% @ 1.5R (Main profit target)
TP3: 20% @ 2R+ or next key level (Bonus profits)
```

### AUTOMATED ORDER PLACEMENT (MANDATORY) üö´

```
IMMEDIATE ON ENTRY (NO EXCEPTIONS):
1. STOP LOSS: Beyond key level (set before analysis)
2. TP1 ORDER: 50% position at 0.75R (automatic close)
3. TP2 ORDER: 30% position at 1.5R (automatic close)
4. PHONE ALARMS: 5min, 30min, 1hr (mandatory)

TIME-BASED FORCED EXITS:
5min: Price not moving favorably = MANUAL EXIT 50%
30min: <0.75R achieved = MANUAL EXIT 50%  
1hr: MANUAL EXIT 80% regardless of P/L

BREAKEVEN TRIGGER:
0.5R ‚Üí Move SL to entry price (automatic)
```

### Price Action Exit Triggers

1. **Trend Break**: Exit if trend structure breaks
2. **Key Level Hit**: Full/partial exit at target level
3. **Reversal Pattern**: Exit if reversal pattern forms
4. **Volume Climax**: Exit on extreme volume spikes
5. **Time Limit**: Exit after 1 hour regardless

## CRITICAL DISCIPLINE RULES (ZERO TOLERANCE) üö´

1. **NEVER trade without 4+ star signal**
2. **NEVER ignore 4H trend direction (must be UP/DOWN)**

5. **NEVER violate time-based exits (5min/30min/1hr)**
6. **NEVER hold past 1hr without 80% exit**
7. **NEVER trade SIDEWAYS markets**

### MANDATORY ACTIONS (ZERO TOLERANCE)

1. **ALWAYS place TP1 & TP2 orders before any analysis**
2. **ALWAYS set phone timers (5m/30m/1hr)**
3. **ALWAYS exit 50% if no movement in 5min**
4. **ALWAYS exit 50% if <0.75R at 30min**
5. **ALWAYS exit 80% at 1hr regardless of P/L**
